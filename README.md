# customer-churn-predictor
The "Customer Churn Predictor" website is designed to help businesses in the telecommunications, subscription 
services, or any industry where customer retention is critical. The project will start by collecting and cleaning historical 
customer data, including demographics, usage patterns, and interactions with the service.
After preprocessing the data, various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random 
forests, or gradient boosting will be employed to train predictive models. These models will be trained on a subset of 
the data and validated using another subset to ensure their accuracy and reliability in predicting customer churn.
Once the models are trained and validated, they will be deployed into a production environment where they can be 
used to predict churn for new customers. The predictions can then be used by businesses to proactively identify at risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or proactive customer support, 
to reduce churn rates and increase customer loyalty.
